introduction: All right, fellows. In this section we will try to cover typical questions
  that many of our customers have.
questions:
- question: How long does shipping take?
  answer: |-
    It depends:

    * US shipping will take between 1 to 3 weeks.
    * International shipping will take between 3 and 4 weeks.
    * Mars shipping will be automatically redirected to Elon Musk’s Twitter account.
- question: How do refunds and returns work?
  answer: |-
    It happens. Even the best processes and quality products will disappoint _someone_:

    * All discounted items sales are final.
    * If your order is not what you expected or misses quality specifications, email us at info@fruitbase.co, send us some pictures with a description of the problem and we’ll send you a new another ASAP!
- question: How do you handle sensitive customer information?
  answer: At Fruitbase we are very transparent and responsible on how we use the data
    that you provide us.  For detailed information please refer to [our ToS and DPA](http://bit.ly/2YJwlyt).
