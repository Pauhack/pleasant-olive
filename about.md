- title: We love plants
  description: Now THAT is true, but we love web development even more. We talk about
    it on our blog, like, [a lot](http://bit.ly/2YA6999). We often craft live demos
    and open source these bad boys [on GitHub](https://github.com/snipcart). Matter
    of fact, this Planty theme [is open source too](https://github.com/snipcart/stackbit-theme-planty)!
    If you spot any bugs, open an issue, and we’ll fire our junior dev. Just kidding
    Michael, you’re good.

- title: We think plants are the future
  description: Word. But good **code** _can_ solve a lots of problems, too. New _and_
    old. That’s why we help beginners get started with web development through free
    content and tools, like this theme. We also believe [the JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/)
    might be one solid pillar on which we build that future.
